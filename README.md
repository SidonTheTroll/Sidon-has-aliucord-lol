## [Aliucord plugins](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord)

The Aliucord plugins just in case I change my device or someone needs them. 

Btw use '/' to utilise the plugins with their name after that.


# Better Status Indicators 

Just like its name, it enchances the status indicators which shows which platform other users (including you) are using. 

# Fake Stickers

Sends the png format of the sticker in the chat directly.


# Message Logger 

Makes a temporary cache to store the messages that are deleted which are removed if you kill (completely close) your Discord client (Aliucord in this case)


# Nanomachines Son! 

Sends [Senator Armstrong's speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmWQd8zhEg4) when used as '/nanomachines' in the chat.


# Nitro Spoof

Use animated emojis and also from other servers, but only works once so I don't use this plugin.


# Playable Embeds

Play the embeds in the client itself. But it might have some issues while playing some youtube videos. 


# Split messages 

Split large messages into sections which can be directly sent in the chat. 


# Token 

Used as '/token' to reveal your Discord Token. NEVER USE THIS AS **'/token send: true'** BECAUSE IT WILL SEND YOUR TOKEN AND MOST OF THE TIME, SOMEONE FROM THE CHAT WILL EXPLOIT WITH YOUR ACCOUNT AND MIGHT SPEND MONEY FROM YOUR CREDIT CARD.


# User Details 
  
Reveals the details of users in the user "[Profile Popup]([https://imgur.com/](https://imgur.com/OjDZskx)" which includes creation date, server join date and last message date which all include the time too.


# View Profile Images 

View the profile picture of any user by pressing on their profile picture in the profile info popup


# Waifu.im 

Uses the **[waifu.im](https://waifu.im) api** to get waifu pics. Optional tags include *tags, nsfw and send*. Select the tags with the 'tags' tag, 'is_nsfw' later with true or false to select the rating of the pics and finaly 'send' tag with true or false parameter to either send the in the chat or look at them privately.
